# Adopt-a-Pet

Welcome to the Pet Adoption Website project! This project showcases my skills in web development using Python's Flask framework to create a user-friendly pet adoption site with multiple routes.

## Project Overview

The Pet Adoption Website simulates the experience of browsing and selecting pets for adoption. Users can explore different categories of animals, view available pets within each category, and access detailed profiles of individual pets.

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install Flask if you haven't already:

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the website.

## Project Structure

## Features
